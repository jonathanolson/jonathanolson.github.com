Hey you &lt;3, I totally forgot to mention something I found online that's remarkably similar to what you described! There's <a href="ring-attack-solo.html">Attack Solo</a>, <a href="ring-attack-duo.html">Attack Duo</a>, <a href="ring-puzzle-solo.html">Puzzle Solo</a>, and <a href="ring-puzzle-duo.html">Puzzle Duo</a>. Instead of, you know, documenting any of the controls, I figured I could show you ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
