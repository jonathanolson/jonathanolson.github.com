<h1>Additive Subset Picking</h1>
<p class="lead">
	How can we choose a subset of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ with as many elements as possible such that the sum of any two elements is distinct?
</p>
<p>
	Formally, we want a subset $S\subset\mathbb{N}$ such that for all distinct unordered pairs
	$\{a,b\} \ne \{c,d\},\, a+b\ne c+d$.
	If we have two pairs of numbers such that $a-b=x$ and $c-d=x$ where $x\ne 0$, then we would have $a+d=b+c$, and thus
	the difference between any two numbers in our subset is unique.
</p>
<p>
	Of note, our valid subsets will be the elements $x \le n$ of
	<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/B2-Sequence.html">$B_2$ sequences</a>.
</p>
<p>
	The naive approach starts with $\{1\}$ and then counts up and adding a number only if it doesn't introduce
	a duplicate pairwise sum. This results in $\{1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 21, 31, 45, 66, 81, 97, \ldots\}$, known as the
	<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Mian-ChowlaSequence.html">Mian-Chowla sequence</a>
	(<a href="http://oeis.org/A005282">OEIS A005282</a>).
</p>
<h2>Coming soon</h2>
<p>Or maybe these are exercises left to the reader?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Investigate referenced articles for $B_2$ sequences.</li>
	<li>Extend to sums of $m$ elements, i.e. using $B_m$ sequences.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Appendix</h2>
<h3>Code for the Mian-Chowla Sequence</h3>
{% highlight python %}
def buildSequence( n ):
	"""Return the Mian-Chowla sequence for n elements.
	Could be more efficient, this is just a very simple sieve.
	"""
	result = [1]
	excluded = set([1])
	differences = set([])

	while len( result ) &lt; n:
		# find the next non-excluded element in the sequence
		x = result[-1]
		while x in excluded:
			x += 1

		# add any new differences between x and previous elements
		for a in result:
			differences.add( abs( a - x ) )

		# add our new element to our reslt sequence
		result.append( x )
		
		# exclude any numbers that would cause a duplicate difference
		# inefficient here, since we would only need to handle the
		# newest lengths
		for a in result:
			for difference in differences:
				excluded.add( a + difference )
				excluded.add( a - difference )
	return result

	Please let me know below if you have any ideas, questions, or corrections about this problem. I'd love to hear new
	approaches or useful concepts that I haven't mentioned (as I may be unaware of them).
