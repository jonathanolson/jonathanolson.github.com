	How can we choose a subset of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ with as many elements as possible such that the sum of any two distinct elements is distinct itself?
</p>
<p>
	A naive approach would start with choosing all $2^k \le n$ since in binary their addition is unique, however
	numbers like $7$ and $11$ can also be added as elements.
