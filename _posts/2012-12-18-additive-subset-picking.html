<h1>Additive Subset Picking</h1>
<p class="lead">
	How can we choose a subset of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ with as many elements as possible such that the sum of any two elements is distinct?
</p>
<p>
	Formally, we want a subset $S\subset\mathbb{N}$ such that for all distinct unordered pairs
	$\{a,b\} \ne \{c,d\},\, a+b\ne c+d$.
	If we have two pairs of numbers such that $a-b=x$ and $c-d=x$ where $x\ne 0$, then we would have $a+d=b+c$, and thus
	the difference between any two numbers in our subset is unique.
</p>
<p>
	Of note, our valid subsets will be the elements $x \le n$ of
	<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/B2-Sequence.html">$B_2$ sequences</a>.
</p>
<p>
	The naive approach starts with $\{1\}$ and then counts up and adding a number only if it doesn't introduce
	a duplicate pairwise sum. This results in $\{1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 21, 31, 45, 66, 81, 97, \ldots\}$, known as the
	<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Mian-ChowlaSequence.html">Mian-Chowla sequence</a>
	(<a href="http://oeis.org/A005282">OEIS A005282</a>).

	<li>Investigate referenced articles for $B_2$ sequences.</li>
	<li>Extend to sums of $m$ elements, i.e. using $B_m$ sequences.</li>
