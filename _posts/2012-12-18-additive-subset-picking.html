<h1>Additive Subset Picking</h1>
<p class="lead">
	How can we choose a subset of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ with as many elements as possible such that the sum of any two distinct elements is distinct itself?
</p>
<p>
	A naive approach would start with choosing all $2^k \le n$ since in binary their addition is unique, however
	numbers like $7$ and $11$ can also be added as elements.
</p>
<h2>Coming soon</h2>
<p>Or maybe these are exercises left to the reader?</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Better "naive" approach: start adding elements to subset incrementally beginning with $1$, on the condition
		that the sum of that element and any existing element is not yet in the subset. This would result in
		$\{1,2,4,7,10,13,16,\ldots\}$.
	</li>
	<li>
		"Last half" approach: pick subset of all numbers $k\ge \lfloor n/2+1 \rfloor$. Thus for the $n=16$ example
		in the improved "naive" approach, we would get $\{8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16\}$.
	</li>
	<li>
		If the "last half" approach is the best, investigate the same problem, but $\pmod{n+1}$.
	</li>
</ul>
